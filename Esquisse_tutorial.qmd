# Introduction

### What is Esquisse?

**Esquisse** package helps to explore and visualize your data interactively. It is a **Shiny**. This package allows you to drag and drop the variables from your dataframe and create ***ggplot*** charts. Moreover, you can export the code to your environment and further change or add extra annotations. After putting everything together, you can export to 'PNG' or 'ppt'(Power Point).

## Installation

First you have to install the package. This can be done by the following command: ***install.packages("esquisse")***

After installation it time to load the required packages to Esquisse work.

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(esquisse)
library(ggthemes)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)


```

After loading these packages we ready to work with some data. Lets take for instance the penguins data frame.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

data <- penguins

head(data)
```

## Executing the esquisse

The esquisse functions is our next step.

```{r}
# esquisse::esquisser()
```

## Making your first plot

We can import the data frame from several sources. But since we already our data in the environment we can pick the default option.

Load de data and you a ready to make your own plots just dragging and dropping the variables. I'll plot some examples below:

After selecting the variables you want to analyze and plot you can change the labels and titles, plot options, appearance, data (scale) and import the code to your script.

## Importing the code

```{r}
#| warning: false
ggplot(data) +
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, colour = species) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This is a fast tutorial on how to use the esquisse package. This can improve our abilities in data analysis and presenting data.
